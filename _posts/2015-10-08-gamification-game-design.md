In early October, I was invited by [Prof. Wagner Damiani, Ph.D.][damiani] to talk about Gamification theory and practice to his undergrad students of [International Program in Management][fgv-ipm] at [FGV’s São Paulo School of Business Administration][fgv] in his **Gamification course**.

It was great to be able to share some ideas about a topic I really like with such brilliant students from around the world.

In this talk I focused on *Game Design* and tried to explain how Gamification is not only about *PBLs* (Points, Badges, and Leaderboards):

![Players]({{ site.url }}/media/gamification_players.png){: .alignright style="width: 35px;"} **Players**:
Identifying them and how important they are in a Gamification initiative.

![Journey]({{ site.url }}/media/gamification_journey.png){: .alignright style="width: 35px;"} **Journey**:
Guiding the players through the "*game*".

![Balance]({{ site.url }}/media/gamification_balance.png){: .alignright style="width: 35px;"} **Balance**:
Keeping the players engaged without neither frustrating or boring them. The *Fun Zone*.

![Experience]({{ site.url }}/media/gamification_experience.png){: .alignright style="width: 35px;"} **Experience**:
*Fun* is engaging, but what can be fun in the context?

![Game Elements]({{ site.url }}/media/gamification_gameelements.png){: .alignright style="width: 35px;"} **Game Elements (Examples)**:
It's not only about points. Are the players *always* aware of the game elements?

Here are the slides of the presentation:

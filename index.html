    <p>
      Brazilian software developer and data cruncher. Experienced agile
      project manager. Full time learner currently working as a Business
      Intelligence consultant. Gamification enthusiast (yes, I do believe
      that <strong>fun</strong> is one of the best ways to engage and
      motivate people).
    </p>
    <p>
      Passionate about sports (specially martial arts) and traveling.
      Influenced by <a href="http://cioccari.com">my wife</a>, I’ve been
      running almost everyday and I’m really enjoying it - and also
      need it :-)
